# The difference between LinuxTech.Me and TecMint.com
## Viewpoint ...
  So my viewpoint on creating LinuxTech.me when TecMint.com is basically about keeping things simple, while TecMint.com is a great resource
  my personal opinion is that
    1. LinuxTech.Me cares about TLDR, and wants the resources quickly served, TecMint.com is guide-orientated and pretty deep
    2. I have no issue with TecMint.com, and personally love the resource, and link to it at LinuxTech.Me
    3. Like a "start page", LinuxTech.Me is a starting point to get to other deeper resources
