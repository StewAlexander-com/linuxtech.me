# The difference between LinuxTech.Me and TecMint.com
## Viewpoint ...
  So my viewpoint on creating LinuxTech.me when TecMint.com sort of fills this space, is basically about keeping things simple, while TecMint.com is a great resource, my personal opinion is that
  
    1. LinuxTech.Me cares deeply about TLDR, and wants the resources quickly served, TecMint.com is guide-orientated and pretty thorough
    2. I have no issue with TecMint.com, and personally love the resource, and link to it at LinuxTech.Me
    3. Like a "start page", LinuxTech.Me is purposefully built to be a starting point to get to other deeper resources
